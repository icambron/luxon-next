* figure out what to do with all the random types floating around
* tests for defaultLocale

Just finished:
  * regex parsing (everything except sql, which I think i'll let be)
  * shiftTo and normalize and as

Next big challenge is diff()
Or could do token parsing
Also need to figure out how to make { setZone } work

A quick sketch of parsing options:

{
  interpretationZone: ...,
  targetZone: ...,
  useTargetZoneFromInput: true
}

* useTargetZoneFromInput trumps targetZone so that it can fall back to targetZone on strings with no offset/zone
* the string trumps interpretationZone, obviously
* provide simpleParsingOptions(zone) that returns { intepretationZone: zone, targetZone: zone, useTargetZoneFromInput: false }
* all zones args are Zoneish

Middle of:
 * Messing with tree shaking in webpack

Big stuff:
 * A new name!
 * Intervals
 * Redo format presets in light of `timeStyle` and `dateStyle`

Others:
 * Also need arbitrary formatting, but that seems pretty easy?
 * Lots of duration work to do, but mostly nbd? (parsing, formatting, etc)
 * Relative time

Organization stuff:
 * nothing now

Odds and ends:
 * tests for defaultLocale
 * tests for toLocaleString() and friends (currently just testing toLocaleParts())
 * search for dummy tests and fill them in

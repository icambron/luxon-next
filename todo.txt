* figure out what to do with all the random types floating around
* tests for defaultLocale

Here's what I'm in the middle of: making the parsing work. Right now the regex stuff just returns a pile of units
(for DTs and Durations, but even for DTs, could be gregorian units or could ordinal, iso week, etc). Need to figure out
how to not make the caller a mess -- e.g. return Calendar + Time pairs? Etc

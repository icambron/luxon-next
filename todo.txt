Middle of:
 * adding formatting support
 * need to make the options handling consistent with the other format stuff
 * need to work through all the tests
 * need to rationalize dependencies (currently needs a bunch off stuff from core)

Big stuff:
 * Build and export
 * A new name!
 * intervals

Others:
 * Also need arbitrary formatting, but that seems pretty easy?
 * Lots of duration work to do, but mostly nbd? (parsing, formatting, etc)
 * Relative time

Organization stuff:

Odds and ends:
 * redo format presets in light of `timeStyle` and `dateStyle`
 * tests for defaultLocale
 * tests for toLocaleString() and friends (currently just testing toLocaleParts())

Notes
-----

Did a deep drive into the future of the pipeline operator:

 * We are currently using "minimal" which assumes the LHS of the pipe is a unary expression. That's why we curry everything
 * There are three proposals: minimal F# (as above), F# with other bells and whistles, and hack-style. (There was also smart-mix, which basically means "use hack-style if there's a topic, otherwise use F#". This is the best proposal, but it's been rejected. So it goes)
 * All are implemented by the babel plugin, but I can only find editor support (e.g. in Webstorm) for the minimal one. So sticking with that for now
 * The TC committee seems to be leaning toward hack. That's fine, but it means we'll uncurry everything. Instead of foo() |> bar(options) |> baz() |> quux, we'll want foo() |> bar(%, options), baz(%), quux(%). `dt` always in the first arg position
 * Going to leave all this in place until we get editor support for hack-style. It's a huge refactor, because you have to uncurry everything all at once, but just a chore in the end
